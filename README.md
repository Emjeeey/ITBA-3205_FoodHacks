# Project Title: Analysis on Why Women and Children are Vulnerable for Human Trafficking in India Year 2019-2020


**Introduction**

Human trafficking, sometimes known as modern-day slavery, is a multibillion-dollar form of international organized crime. It is illegal use of force, deception, or compulsion to gain labor or commercial sex acts. Victims might be of any age, ethnicity, gender, or nationality, and it can happen in any society. To attract victims into trafficking situations, traffickers may employ violence, manipulation, or false promises of well-paying jobs or personal relationships. To seduce their victims into work or commercial sexual exploitation, traffickers utilize force, deceit, or compulsion. They are looking for people who are vulnerable for a variety of reasons, such as psychological or emotional weakness, economic difficulty, a lack of social safety net, natural calamities, or political instability. Many victims may not recognize themselves as victims or seek aid, even in extremely public circumstances, due to the stress created by traffickers.
	India is the world's second-largest country, with a current population of 1.3 billion people. However, its magnitude brings a slew of human rights concerns. With so many people in one country, it's easy for many of them to slip through the cracks. Human trafficking is one of India's most serious human rights issues. According to a poll of global experts, India is the most dangerous country for women because of the high risk of sexual violence and being forced into slave labor (Thomson Reuters Foundation, 2018). It is also stated in National Crime Records Bureau that 33,855 people in India were victims of kidnapping for the purpose of marriage in 2016. Individuals under the age of 18 made up half of this percentage. The most popular methods used by kidnappers are commercial sex and indentured slavery. According to a UNODC survey from 2013, nine out of ten households in the Indian state of Haryana bought brides from destitute areas throughout the country. According to the report, the majority of the women were subjected to abuse, rape, and forced labor.	
  There are also child kidnappings occur alongside the women's trade. Kidnappers force many of the victims to work in the agricultural and manufacturing industries. According to India Today a popular news platform in India, it stated that in 2017, 26 kids went missing from the railway stations. Out of the 22 missing kids, 9 were abducted from the New Delhi Railway station while 8 of them were kidnapped from the Old Delhi station. The majority of these disappearances go unnoticed due to the station's hectic atmosphere. Because of poverty and violence at home, many of these children either live near the station or travel out to work despite the dangers and illegality of child labor. Despite being the world's largest democratic republic, India suffers from widespread poverty and a lack of sufficient education, leading to a slew of human rights violations, particularly against women, girls, and children. 
  Despite being the world's largest democratic republic, India suffers from widespread poverty and a lack of sufficient education, leading to a slew of human rights violations, particularly against women and girls. This study aims to discover why women and children are the most vulnerable for human trafficking, why people are being kidnapped and for what reason using the datasets that contains information about total number of human trafficking cases reported per State/Union Territories in India, number of victims trafficked/rescued, nationality of the victims, age-group, purpose of trafficking, police and court disposal of cases, and number of culprits arrested/acquitted in year 2019-2020. 

  
  
  
**Problem Statement**

 Human Trafficking is not an easy topic and issue to begin with but for someone who has the control on power, money and law can easily outrun the truth and justice as much as its convenient to their advantages. Despite the fact that human trafficking is predominantly a transnational organized crime, India, like many other South Asian countries, is increasingly becoming a source, transit point, and destination for traffickers. The essence of the problem is that, because human trafficking is a very hidden and clandestine enterprise, it is mostly under-reported and untraced, despite various international initiatives urging governments to take action. As of today, the citizens of India face a great hindrance in attaining their rights and equal treatment as there are many variables that deny it. With that being said the lack of attention and strong punishment with the violators are one of the main problems that needs to be immediately addressed. 
Human trafficking is estimated to afflict between 20 and 65 million persons in India. Women and girls are transported inside the country for commercial sexual exploitation and forced marriage, particularly in locations where the gender ratio is heavily skewed toward men. A large number of youngsters are compelled to work as factory laborers, household servants, beggars, and farm labourers, while some are used as child soldiers by rebel or terrorist groups. India is the most unsafe country for women, according to a poll of worldwide experts, due to the high risk of sexual abuse and enslavement (Thomson Reuters Foundation, 2018). According to the Central Bureau of Investigation, 135,000 children in India are victims of human trafficking each year. This indicates that India's citizens and people are being violated against their wills, demonstrating how serious the situation is within the country's administration.
Despite being the world's largest democratic republic, India suffers from widespread poverty and a lack of sufficient education, which leads to a slew of human rights violations, particularly against women and girls.





**Objective of the Study**

 The objective of this study are:
i. To raise awareness that many people have been manipulated to do wrongdoings or have been abused because of human trafficking.
