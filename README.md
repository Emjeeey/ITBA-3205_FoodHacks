# Project Title: FoodHacks

Introduction

      Food “waste” refers to food that is fit for consumption but consciously discarded at the retail or consumption phases (Harvard T.H Chan, 2021). According to Fusion (2016), food waste refers to food appropriate for human consumption being discarded, whether or not after it is kept beyond its expiry date or left to spoil. Often this is because food has spoiled but it can be for other reasons such as oversupply due to markets, or individual consumer shopping/eating habits.From all the foods that are being produced for consumption in the world, 40% of it is those edible that never get eaten and what considered as food waste which is equivalent to a third of global production. Therefore, there are about 365 million pounds of food waste produced in every single day and 1.3 billion tons in every year. In 2014, a rising global effect of chronic food deprivation orthe restriction of free access to foodhave brought significant impact to a absolute variety of people, from 775 million going to 777 million in 2015, and estimated to increased in year of 2016 consisting of 815 million people. People discard 931 million tonnes of food annually with per capita food waste averaging 74kg per household. (Food Waste Index, 2021). However, large of quantities of food are also reported to be disposed by supermarkets and other enterprises including  244 million tonnes from food service and about 118 million tonnes that came from retails, which are strongly seen of adding to the hundreds of millions of tonnes produced per year.

     In U.S, food waste problem was estimated to be appreciably lower even though they are discarding almost one quarter of all food purchased by private households which directly get wasted. While in the United Kingdom, there is a similar disparity between actual and estimated food waste. However, citizens there still say that they use 95 percent of their groceries although 15 percent of Britons' food ends up in the bin.Affluent nations like Norway, Hong Kong, Germany, and other countries who are on the top of the list are mostly to have the more tendency to throw out a maximum amount of food compare to those developing countries which wasting much smaller amounts. In fact, among 177 countries that have been part of the analysis only 40 of them were identified as not wasting any food since the availability and supply of food on their resident was insufficient to meet their daily caloric needs.
     
 
 Problem Statement
 
    Food waste is one of the leading problems that we have in the world. Hence, a solution for this issue is not that given a wide attention, wherein even a small contribution in order to lessen our food waste will be indeed a great help to us, to our environment, to our economy and to our world. With that being said, food innovations nowadays were known, which provides us new ideas, new recipe and new foods. There are many data or information about new recipes that we can make out of our leftover foods or foods that we just usually throw and foods that we chose not to consume anymore. Hence despite of having that information in the internet not all people are showing interest on it since they are unaware of this information. Wherein, the lack of knowledge about this issue is what makes it a bigger problem as days pass by. Consecutively, living in the 21st century were all people depend most on technology will be a great advantage for us to spread the issue about food waste. Many applications were develop nowadays that most of the people used to get important information, to be entertained, to guide them in many ways and much other kind of applications. Hence, despite the enormous application nowadays, there are no applications that specifically tackle food waste or an application that wants to somehow solve this issue. To sum it up, as a metaphor for this current situation is that all the foods are ready to be served to the people in order for them to consume and what only lacks is the one who will serve it. With that being said, what the world needs right now is a technology or an application that could help lessen our problem with food waste.
