# Project Title: An Analysis on Human Trafficking in India Year 2019-2020

**Introduction**

Human trafficking, sometimes known as modern-day slavery, is a multibillion-dollar form of international organized crime. It is illegal use of force, deception, or compulsion to gain labor or commercial sex acts. Victims might be of any age, ethnicity, gender, or nationality, and it can happen in any society. To attract victims into trafficking situations, traffickers may employ violence, manipulation, or false promises of well-paying jobs or personal relationships. To seduce their victims into work or commercial sexual exploitation, traffickers utilize force, deceit, or compulsion. They are looking for people who are vulnerable for a variety of reasons, such as psychological or emotional weakness, economic difficulty, a lack of social safety net, natural calamities, or political instability. Many victims may not recognize themselves as victims or seek aid, even in extremely public circumstances, due to the stress created by traffickers.
	India is the world's second-largest country, with a current population of 1.3 billion people. However, its magnitude brings a slew of human rights concerns. With so many people in one country, it's easy for many of them to slip through the cracks. Human trafficking is one of India's most serious human rights issues. According to a poll of global experts, India is the most dangerous country for women because of the high risk of sexual violence and being forced into slave labor (Thomson Reuters Foundation, 2018). It is also stated in National Crime Records Bureau that 33,855 people in India were victims of kidnapping for the purpose of marriage in 2016. Individuals under the age of 18 made up half of this percentage. The most popular methods used by kidnappers are commercial sex and indentured slavery. According to a UNODC survey from 2013, nine out of ten households in the Indian state of Haryana bought brides from destitute areas throughout the country. According to the report, the majority of the women were subjected to abuse, rape, and forced labor.	
  There are also child kidnappings occur alongside the women's trade. Kidnappers force many of the victims to work in the agricultural and manufacturing industries. According to the Central Bureau of Investigation, 135,000 children in India are victims of human trafficking each year. According to India Today a popular news platform in India, it stated that in 2017, 26 kids went missing from the railway stations. Out of the 22 missing kids, 9 were abducted from the New Delhi Railway station while 8 of them were kidnapped from the Old Delhi station. The majority of these disappearances go unnoticed due to the station's hectic atmosphere. Because of poverty and violence at home, many of these children either live near the station or travel out to work despite the dangers and illegality of child labor.
