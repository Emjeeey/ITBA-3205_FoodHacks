# Project Title: Analysis on Why Women and Children are Vulnerable for Human Trafficking in India 


**Introduction**

Modern-day slavery, often known as human trafficking, is a multibillion-dollar form of worldwide organized crime. Using force, deceit, or compulsion to get work or commercial sex acts is unlawful. Victims might be of any age, ethnicity, gender, or nationality, and it can happen anywhere in the world. Traffickers may use violence, manipulation, or false promises of well-paying jobs or personal connections to lure victims into trafficking situations. TTraffickers use force, deception, or compulsion to entice their victims into job or commercial sexual exploitation. They're seeking for those who are vulnerable due to psychological or emotional issues, economic hardship, a lack of social safety net, or political instability. Due to the stress produced by traffickers, many victims may not recognize themselves as victims or seek help, even in very public settings.
	India is the world's second-largest country, with a current population of 1.3 billion people.However, because of its large population, it raises numerous human rights concerns. People can easily fall between the cracks when there are so many individuals in one country. According to a survey of international experts, India is the most dangerous country for women due to the high risk of sexual abuse and forced labor (Thomson Reuters Foundation, 2018). In 2016, 33,855 Indians were victims of kidnapped for the purpose of marriage, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. Half of the people in this age group were under the age of 18. Commercial sex and indentured slavery are two of the most common kidnapping techniques. A UNODC report from 2013 found that nine out of ten households in the Indian state of Haryana purchased wives from impoverished areas around the country. The majority of the women were abused, raped, or forced to work, according to the report.	
  Along with the women's trade, there are also kidnappings of children. Many of the victims are forced to labor in the agricultural and manufacturing industries by their kidnappers. According to India Today, a renowned news outlet in India, 26 children went missing from train stations in 2017. Nine of the 22 missing children were snatched from New Delhi Railway Station, while eight were abducted from Old Delhi Railway Station. Due to the busy nature of the station, the bulk of these disappearances go unreported. Many of these children reside near the station or travel out to work despite the dangers and illegality of child labor because of poverty and violence at home. Despite being the world's largest democratic republic, India is plagued by poverty and a lack of adequate education, resulting in a spate of human rights violations, particularly against women, girls, and children.
  In countries with a significant number of children, such as India, children are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking. In India, this matter has already become a crisis. According to the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy, the crisis was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the unemployment of 122 million people in India. Children are more vulnerable when their families are financially insecure, according to Neetah Lal. Traffickers prey on these families by offering them a new job, more income, better living conditions, and financial support. Child labor continues to thrive throughout huge areas of India, with industry studies suggesting that over eight million children aged five to fourteen toil in fields, unsafe factories, shops, and houses.
  Aside from the victims' vulnerability, traffickers are motivated by a number of motives. The scale of the problem is enormous, according to India's 2008 Integrated Plan of Action to Prevent and Combat Human Trafficking, "both in terms of the growing number of trafficked people and the growing number of locations." Traffickers are motivated by high profits and a low risk of detection due to weak law enforcement and low prosecution levels.
  Despite being the world's largest democratic republic, India is plagued by poverty and a lack of adequate education, resulting in a spate of human rights violations, notably against women and girls. Using the datasets acquired by the researchers, this study intends to determine why women and children are the most vulnerable to human trafficking, why people are kidnapped, and for what reason.
  
  
**Problem Statement**

 Human trafficking is a difficult topic and issue to begin with, but for those in positions of power, money and the law may quickly outrun the truth and justice to their benefit. Despite the fact that human trafficking is primarily a transnational organized crime, India, like many other South Asian countries, is becoming an increasingly important source, transit place, and destination for traffickers. Human trafficking is a very hidden and secretive business, therefore it goes mostly unreported and untraced, despite several international attempts pushing governments to intervene. As of today, Indian individuals face significant challenges in obtaining their rights and receiving equitable treatment due to a variety of factors. As a result, one of the most pressing issues that must be addressed quickly is a lack of attention and harsh penalty for violators.
 Human trafficking affects between 20 and 65 million people in India. Women and girls are trafficked inside the country for commercial sexual exploitation and forced marriage, particularly in areas where men outnumber women. Many children are forced to work as factory workers, domestic servants, beggars, and farm laborers, and some are exploited as child soldiers by rebel or terrorist groups. India is the most unsafe country for women, according to a poll of worldwide experts, due to the high risk of sexual abuse and enslavement (Thomson Reuters Foundation, 2018). According to the Central Bureau of Investigation, 135,000 children in India are victims of human trafficking each year. This indicates that India's citizens and people are being violated against their wills, demonstrating how serious the situation is within the country's administration.
 Despite being the world's largest democratic republic, India faces widespread poverty and a lack of adequate education, resulting in a spate of human rights violations, notably against women and girls.



**Objective of the Study**

 The objective of this study are:
 
i.   To determine the reason why women and children in India are prone in human trafficking.

ii.  To determine the main purpose and agenda of human trafficking in India.

iii. To be able to raise awareness regarding human trafficking most especially in the country of India and to create solution on how to prevent it.


 



 **Methods**
 
This research will concentrate on information on the primary elements that contribute to human trafficking. The researchers can study the information acquired, evaluate, and rank the variables of human trafficking by developing a data analysis about them. This study takes an analytical method, which helps the researchers break down the facts and information pertinent to the study and add elements that reflect a solution to the problem. To evaluate and analyze issues associated to human trafficking, important and relevant information was obtained from credible sources and articles on the internet.
 
 
 
 **Expected Output**
 
 The growing number of human trafficking victims may result in a variety of crimes as well as a significant impediment to their social rights and equality. Human trafficking is the second greatest organized crime in India, according to the UNODC website. Despite the fact that human trafficking is illegal in India, it remains a huge problem. The goal of this project is to create an exploratory data analysis based on information acquired from reputable sources about human trafficking instances in India. The information gathered will be analyzed and used to create a human trafficking awareness campaign that can potentially educate individuals, particularly women and children, about their rights and the effects of human trafficking in order to reduce victimization among vulnerable populations, particularly in India.
